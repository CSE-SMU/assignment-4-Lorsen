# Assignment 4 Postmortem

## What's your name?
Omar Roa

## How difficult was this assignment?
This was very difficult for me.  I was not used to the syntax at all. The use of words of directive and controller seemed unintuitive to me. I had to go through some of codeschool's shaping with angularjs to start working on it with some knowledge. Unfortunately, I was also sick for most of the week so I didn't get to start this assignment until Thursday morning. That bug is going around.


## Did you learn anything new from this assignment?
Yeah! I feel like I know a lot more about AngularJS, and plan to watch more videos and finish the codeschool course. I also learned that w3 schools and google's forums are my friends.


## How could this assignment be improved?
While I liked the openness of the assignment, I was surprised by the deviation from the previous assignments.  It made me do much more research than I did previous assignments.


## Any other comments?
I feel like I would personally benefit from trying more coding examples in class and slowing down a bit rather than going through documentation at the pace we did, especially if we're going to do another new topic again.
